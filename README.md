# ComfyUI-SaveImageWithMetaDataUniversal
![SaveImageWithMetaData Preview](img/save_image_with_metadata_universal.png)
> Enhanced Automatic1111‚Äëstyle, Civitai-compatible metadata capture with extended support for prompt encoders, LoRA and model loaders, embeddings, samplers, clip models, guidance, shift, and more.

- An extensive rework of the [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) custom node pack [ComfyUI-SaveImageWithMetaData](https://github.com/nkchocoai/ComfyUI-SaveImageWithMetaData/), that attempts to add **universal support for all custom node packs**, while also adding explicit support for a few custom nodes.
- The `Save Image w/ Metadata Universal` node saves images with metadata extracted automatically from the input values of any node‚Äîno manual node connecting required.
- Provides full support for saving workflows and metadata to WEBP images.
- Supports saving workflows and metadata to JPEGs (limited to 64KB‚Äîonly smaller workflows can be saved to JPEGs).
- Stores model hashes in `.sha256` files so you only ever have to hash models once, saving lots of time.
- Includes `Metadata Rule Scanner` and `Save Custom Metadata Rules` nodes, which scan all installed nodes and generate metadata capture rules
- Designed to work with most custom packs and fall back gracefully when a node lacks heuristics (I can't test with every custom node pack, but it has been working well so far).
- Since the value extraction rules are created dynamically, values output by most custom nodes can be added to metadata.
- Tested with SD1.5, SDXL, FLUX, QWEN, WAN (2.1 supported); GGUF, Nunchaku

## Note
<details open>
<summary><strong>More:</strong></summary>

- I'm an amateur at coding, at best. I started writing this myself, but as I began increasing the scope of the project I started using a Copilot.
- If you have any questions, think any documentation is lacking, or experience issues with certain workflows or custom node packs, create a new issue an I'll try and see if it's something I can address.

## Quick Start
<details open>
<summary><strong>More:</strong></summary>

1. Use the `Metadata Rule Scanner` + `Save Custom Metadata Rules` nodes to create and save capture rules (see [`example_workflows/scan-and-save-custom-metadata-rules.png`](example_workflows/scan-and-save-custom-metadata-rules.png)).
2. Add `Save Image w/ Metadata Universal` to your workflow and connect to the image input to save images using your custom capture ruleset.
3. (Optional) Use `Create Extra MetaData` node(s) to manually record additional info.
4. (Optional) For full Civitai style parity enable the `civitai_sampler` and `guidance_as_cfg` toggles in the save node.
5. Prefer PNG (or lossless WebP) when you need guaranteed full workflow embedding (JPEG has strict size limits‚Äî[see tips below](#format-&-fallback-quick-tips)).
6. Hover any parameters on the nodes in this pack for concise tooltips (fallback stages, `max_jpeg_exif_kb`, LoRA summary toggle, guidance‚ÜíCFG mapping, sampler naming, filename tokens). For further detail see: [Node UI Parameters](#node-ui-parameters-key-additions), [JPEG Metadata Size & Fallback Behavior](#jpeg-metadata-size--fallback-behavior); advanced env tuning: [Environment Flags](#environment-flags).

## Feature Overview
<details>
<summary><strong>More:</strong></summary>

* Automatic1111‚Äëstyle, Civitai-compatible parameter string (single‚Äëline) with optional multi‚Äëline deterministic test mode (`METADATA_TEST_MODE=1`).
* Dynamic rule generation: `Metadata Rule Scanner` + `Save Custom Metadata Rules` create and save user rules, allowing broad custom node coverage.
* LoRA handling:
  * Detects single and stack loaders & inline `<lora:name:sm[:sc]>` tags such as those used in [ComfyUI Prompt Control](https://github.com/asagi4/comfyui-prompt-control) and [ComfyUI LoRA Manager](https://github.com/willmiao/ComfyUI-Lora-Manager):
    <div style="width:60%;">
    
    ![Diagram illustrating LoRA loader functionality, showing a parsing-supported LoRA Manager node with inline tags](img/lora-loader.png) 
    </div>
  * Aggregated optional condensed summary line `LoRAs: name(str_model/str_clip)` plus per‚ÄëLoRA detailed entries (hashes & strengths retained even if summary hidden).
* Prompt encoder compatibility: handles multiple encoder styles (e.g. dual Flux T5 + CLIP) with aliasing and suppression of redundant unified positives.
* Full PNG + lossless WebP workflow + metadata embedding; JPEG with staged fallback under 64KB EXIF limit.
  * See detailed fallback staging: [docs/JPEG_METADATA_FALLBACK.md](docs/JPEG_METADATA_FALLBACK.md)
* Embedding name resolution & hashing with safe path normalization; model hash caching via `.sha256` sidecar files for speed after first run.
* Configurable guidance mapping (`guidance_as_cfg`) and sampler naming normalization (minimal, avoids unexpected renames) for Civitai compatibility.
* `Create Extra MetaData` node specifies metadata to be added to the image to be saved. Example: In [extra_metadata.json](example_workflows/extra_metadata.json).
* Selective verbosity: hide hash detail (`METADATA_NO_HASH_DETAIL`) and/or aggregated LoRA summary (`METADATA_NO_LORA_SUMMARY` or UI toggle).
* Stable field ordering for reproducible diffs & tooling.
* Runtime evaluation of env flags‚Äîrestart not required for changes.
  * Environment flag reference: [Environment Flags](#environment-flags)
* Clear fallback signaling via `Metadata Fallback: <stage>` token in parameter string when JPEG trimming occurs.
* Wan 2.1 example workflow is available: [example_workflows/wan21_text_to_image.json](example_workflows/wan21_text_to_image.json). It demonstrates prompt encoding, WanVideo Sampler with combined "scheduler" input (parsed into Sampler/Scheduler), VAE decode, and saving with enriched metadata.
* Plays nicely with most custom node packs out‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëbox (in my somewhat limited testing).

</details>

## Format & Fallback Quick Tips
<details>
<summary><strong>More:</strong></summary>

* JPEG vs PNG/WebP: JPEG has a hard ~64KB EXIF ceiling for text data; large workflows trigger staged fallback trimming (see [detailed fallback](#jpeg-metadata-size--fallback-behavior)). Use PNG / lossless WebP for archival.
* Control JPEG attempt text data size: `max_jpeg_exif_kb` (default 60, max 64) caps EXIF payload before fallback (see [Node UI Parameters](#node-ui-parameters-key-additions)). (i.e. sets max text written to JPEG) before fallback stages engage.
* Detect fallback: If the metadata parameters string ends with `Metadata Fallback: <stage>`, this means max JPEG text data limit was hit and trimming occurred (`reduced-exif`, `minimal`, or `com-marker`) ‚Äî see [Fallback Stages](#fallback-stages--indicator).
* LoRA summary line: Toggle with `include_lora_summary`. Adds an abbreviated summary of LoRAs used. If off, only individual `Lora_*` entries remain.

## Node UI Parameters (Key Additions)
<details>
<summary><strong>More:</strong></summary>

Key quality‚Äëof‚Äëlife and compatibility controls exposed by the primary save node:

* `include_lora_summary` (BOOLEAN, default True): Toggles the aggregated `LoRAs:` summary line; when False only individual `Lora_*` entries are emitted. UI setting overrides env flags.
* `guidance_as_cfg` (BOOLEAN, default False): Substitutes the captured `Guidance` value into `CFG scale` and omits the separate `Guidance:` field for better A1111 / Civitai parity when models expose guidance separately.
* `max_jpeg_exif_kb` (INT, default 60, min 4, max 64): UI‚Äëenforced ceiling for attempted JPEG EXIF payload. Real-world single APP1 EXIF segment limit is ~64KB; exceeding it triggers staged fallback (reduced-exif ‚Üí minimal ‚Üí com-marker). For large workflows prefer PNG / lossless WebP.
* `suppress_missing_class_log` (BOOLEAN, default False): Hide the informational log listing missing classes that would trigger a user JSON rules merge. Useful to reduce noise in large custom node environments.

</details>

## JPEG Metadata Size & Fallback Behavior
<details>
<summary><strong>More:</strong></summary>

JPEG metadata is constrained by a single APP1 (EXIF) segment (~64KB). This repository enforces a hard UI cap of 64KB for `max_jpeg_exif_kb`; values above this provide no benefit and are rejected by Pillow or stripped by consumers. Large prompt + workflow JSON + hash detail can exceed the limit quickly.

When saving JPEG, the node evaluates total EXIF size vs `max_jpeg_exif_kb` (<=64) and applies staged fallback, attempting to write as much info to the EXIF as possible:
1. full (no message) ‚Äî Full EXIF (workflow + parameters) fits.
2. reduced-exif ‚Äî EXIF shrunk to parameters-only `UserComment`.
3. minimal ‚Äî Trimmed parameter string (core fields + LoRAs + hashes) embedded as EXIF.
4. com-marker ‚Äî EXIF dropped entirely; trimmed parameters stored in a JPEG COM marker.

If a fallback stage is used the parameters string gets an appended token: `Metadata Fallback: <stage>`.

Recommendations:
* Keep `max_jpeg_exif_kb` between 48‚Äì64 (the upper bound is enforced).
* Prefer PNG or lossless WebP when you require guaranteed full workflow embedding.
* Treat JPEG as delivery/export; archive originals as PNG if full metadata fidelity matters.

Limitations:
* Social platforms often strip both EXIF and COM markers; consider sidecar archival if critical.
* COM marker text has no structure; downstream tooling must parse the plain parameter string.
* Multi-segment APPn fragmentation (splitting across several EXIF/APP markers) is not implemented (deferred; see `docs/WORKFLOW_COMPRESSION_DESIGN.md`).
 * For more nuance on staged trimming: [docs/JPEG_METADATA_FALLBACK.md](docs/JPEG_METADATA_FALLBACK.md)

### Fallback Stages & Indicator
JPEG saves record a `Metadata Fallback:` stage when size constraints trigger progressive trimming:

| Stage | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `none` | Full EXIF (workflow + parameters) written within limit (stage not emitted) |
| `reduced-exif` | EXIF shrunk to parameters-only UserComment |
| `minimal` | Parameters string trimmed to minimal allowlist (prompt, negative prompt, core generation fields, LoRA entries, hashes) and embedded as EXIF |
| `com-marker` | All EXIF removed (too large); minimal parameters written into a JPEG COM marker |

When a fallback occurs the `Metadata Fallback: <stage>` marker is appended to the parameters string to aid downstream tooling.

NOTE: The `force_include_node_class` input is provided by the `Metadata Rule Scanner` node.

</details>

## Metadata Rule Tools
<details>
<summary><strong>More:</strong></summary>

The rule tooling consists of two cooperating nodes plus an optional scanner input:

### Scanner (`Metadata Rule Scanner`)
* Inputs: `exclude_keywords`, `include_existing`, `mode`, `force_include_metafields`.
* Scans installed nodes and suggests capture rules + sampler mappings.
* Produces JSON rule suggestions + a human‚Äëreadable diff summary.

### Force Include (`Metadata Force Include`)
* Inputs: `force_include_node_class` (multiline), `reset_forced` (bool), `dry_run` (optional bool).
* Maintains a global set of node class names treated as required when loading user metadata definitions.
* Output: Comma‚Äëjoined list of currently forced classes (`FORCED_CLASSES`).

You can connect the second plain `STRING` output (`forced_classes_str`) directly to `Show Text (UniMeta)` to display the active forced class list for auditing.

`SaveImageWithMetaDataUniversal` merges the forced class set before deciding whether to load user JSON definition files.

### Scanner Input: `force_include_node_class`
Optional multiline field accepted by the scanner. Provide exact class names (comma or newline separated) to forcibly include those nodes in scan results even if they:
* Match one of the `exclude_keywords`, or
* Would normally be omitted by `mode` (e.g. `existing_only` skipping additional nodes).

Output effects:
* `summary.forced_node_classes` lists them.
* `diff_report` appends a `Forced node classes=` segment.
* If a forced class yields no heuristic suggestions, an empty object is emitted so tooling can still merge or annotate it.

</details>

## Reference examples (JSON/Python)
<details>
<summary><strong>More:</strong></summary>

Reference-only files you can use as a guide when customizing rules. These are never loaded by the runtime as-is:

- `saveimage_unimeta/user_captures_examples.json` ‚Äî JSON examples for capture rules. Copy snippets you need into `saveimage_unimeta/user_captures.json` to activate. Uses MetaField names as strings (e.g., "MODEL_HASH") and callable names as strings (e.g., "calc_model_hash").
- `saveimage_unimeta/user_samplers_example.json` ‚Äî JSON examples for sampler role mapping. Copy into `saveimage_unimeta/user_samplers.json` if you need to map semantic roles ("positive"/"negative") to actual input names on sampler-like nodes.
- `saveimage_unimeta/defs/ext/generated_user_rules_examples.py` ‚Äî Python examples mirroring the real `generated_user_rules.py` schema, including a `KNOWN` mapping for callables. This module is not imported by the loader and serves only as a reference.

Notes:
- Only `saveimage_unimeta/user_captures.json` and `saveimage_unimeta/user_samplers.json` are conditionally merged at runtime when needed.
- Python extensions in `saveimage_unimeta/defs/ext/` are loaded, except any module named `__*`, ending in `*_examples`, or `generated_user_rules_examples` which are intentionally skipped.

</details>

## Troubleshooting / FAQ
<details>
<summary><strong>More:</strong></summary>

### Why is my workflow JSON missing in a JPEG? 

The save exceeded `max_jpeg_exif_kb` and fell back to `reduced-exif`, `minimal`, or `com-marker`. Use PNG / WebP or lower the workflow size.

### I see `Metadata Fallback: minimal` ‚Äî did I lose important info?  
Only non-core keys were trimmed. Prompts, sampler settings, LoRAs, hashes, seed, model & VAE info remain.

### Forced node shows up with empty `{}` in scanner output. Bug?  
No‚Äî`force_include_node_class` guarantees presence even if no heuristic rules match yet; use it as an anchor for manual rules.

### My LoRA summary line disappeared.  
Either `include_lora_summary=False` in the node or the `METADATA_NO_LORA_SUMMARY` env flag was set (UI param takes precedence).

### Parameter string suddenly multiline.  
Environment variable `METADATA_TEST_MODE=1` was set (intended for tests). Unset it for production single-line mode.

### Why are hashes missing detail JSON?  
Environment flag `METADATA_NO_HASH_DETAIL` suppresses the extended hash breakdown.

### How do I know which fallback stage occurred programmatically?  
Parse the tail of the parameters string for `Metadata Fallback:`. (A future explicit key may be added.)

### Metadata Rule Scanner doesn‚Äôt find the nodes I want to capture
- Check `exclude_keywords` on the scanner. If a class name or pack prefix matches, the scanner filters it out.
- Set `mode` to the broadest scan (e.g., include new + existing) and enable `include_existing` so suggestions merge with known rules.
- Use `force_include_node_class` (exact class names, comma/newline separated) to force discovery even if it would be filtered.
  - Tip: Find the exact class name via the node‚Äôs ‚Äútype‚Äù in ComfyUI (or export workflow JSON and copy the class name).
- Use the `Metadata Force Include` node and wire its `forced_classes_str` to `Show Text (UniMeta)` to verify your forced list.
- If the node still doesn‚Äôt appear, open an issue with: node pack name, node class, your scanner inputs, and a minimal workflow.

### Scanner found my nodes but the suggested rules look wrong or fields are missing
- Treat the scanner output as a starting point. Some nodes require manual mapping of inputs to metadata fields.
- Open `Show generated_user_rules.py`, adjust the suggested capture paths to match your node‚Äôs sockets/fields, then `Save generated_user_rules.py`.
- Prefer explicit hints:
  - Use scanner input `force_include_metafields` to bias suggestions toward specific fields you care about first.
  - If your downstream needs Civitai-style names, enable `civitai_sampler` in the save node and `guidance_as_cfg` when appropriate.
- Sampler/scheduler mismatches: verify the node that actually did sampling (see Sampler Selection Method) and ensure its inputs are captured.
- LoRA/embedding not showing:
  - Ensure those loaders exist in the graph upstream of sampling and are not bypassed.
  - Inline tags like `<lora:name:sm[:sc]>` are detected; loader nodes may still need class forcing so they‚Äôre included in rule generation.
- Hashes missing: make sure models/VAEs/LoRAs are readable by the process; hash sidecars (`.sha256`) are used when present, else computed.
- Hash detail JSON absent: check that `METADATA_NO_HASH_DETAIL` is not set (UI parameter takes precedence where applicable).
- JPEG missing fields is not a rules error: it‚Äôs a size fallback. Use PNG/WebP or increase `max_jpeg_exif_kb` within the 64KB cap.

Quick checklist when metadata seems incomplete:
- Run the save with `METADATA_TEST_MODE=1` for deterministic multiline output and easier diffing.
- Temporarily set a small `max_jpeg_exif_kb` to exercise fallback stages and confirm minimal allowlist contents.
- Enable `METADATA_DEBUG_PROMPTS=1` to log prompt/alias capture decisions (review logs for skipped or aliased fields).
- Force‚Äëinclude the node classes involved, rescan, and re‚Äësave user rules; then verify with `Show generated_user_rules.py`.

## Advanced / Power Users
<details>
<summary><strong>More:</strong></summary>

### Design / Future Ideas
Deferred and exploratory concepts are documented in:
* `docs/WORKFLOW_COMPRESSION_DESIGN.md` (workflow compression placeholder)
* `docs/FUTURE_AND_PROTOTYPES.md` (archived prototype UI + additional speculative enhancements; Wan2.2 and multi-model workflow support)

### Environment Flags
| Flag | Effect |
| ---- | ------ |
| `METADATA_NO_HASH_DETAIL` | Suppress structured `Hash detail` JSON section. |
| `METADATA_NO_LORA_SUMMARY` | Suppress aggregated `LoRAs:` summary (UI `include_lora_summary` overrides). |
| `METADATA_TEST_MODE` | Switch parameter string to multiline deterministic format for tests. |
| `METADATA_DEBUG_PROMPTS` | Enable verbose prompt capture / aliasing debug logs. |

Additional Support:
* LoRA / model file extension recognition includes `.st` wherever `.safetensors` is accepted (hashing, detection, index building).

Precedence for LoRA summary: UI param `include_lora_summary` (explicit) > env flag > default include.

### Parameter String Formatting Modes
* Production: Single-line A1111-compatible string.
* Test: One key per line (stable ordering) when `METADATA_TEST_MODE` is set‚Äîfacilitates snapshot diffing.

### Ordering Guarantees
Stable output characteristics to aid tooling & reproducibility:
* Stable ordering of captured metadata fields; new fields are appended only.
* Parameter string key order deterministic (single‚Äëline & test multi‚Äëline modes).
* Fallback marker (`Metadata Fallback: <stage>`) appended at most once and only when trimming occurred.
* JPEG fallback stage tracking aligns with documented progression (full ‚Üí reduced-exif ‚Üí minimal ‚Üí com-marker).
