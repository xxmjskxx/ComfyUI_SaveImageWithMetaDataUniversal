This is different from the scanner’s optional force_include_node_class input, which only affects rule suggestion generation; this node affects actual save‑time metadata assembly.\n\nUse it to: (1) preserve handcrafted rule blocks for rare loaders/samplers, (2) keep stable parameter string structure / diff consistency, (3) bridge heuristic gaps in fast‑changing custom packs, (4) pre‑anchor future manual rules (empty now, populated later). It doesn’t fabricate data—if the node truly isn’t in the graph, you just keep the slot available.\n\nHow: add the node → list exact class names (newline or comma separated) in force_include_node_class → optionally toggle reset_forced when redefining the set. Keep the list small (only what you rely on); prune stale entries periodically. Scanner for discovery; Force Include for runtime stability.\nUse Metadata Rule Scanner to scan all currently installed nodes. You can display the rules generated by Metadata Rule Scanner as a string in JSON format in a Show Text node.\n\nIf you see any entries you'd like to remove, you can do so. If you understand the formatting and syntax, you can add custom node entries as well. \n\nOnce you're happy with the list, paste it into the Save Custom Metadata Rules node and run that node. Your rules will be written to */custom_nodes/ComfyUI_SaveImageWithMetaDataUniversal/saveimage_unimeta/defs/ext/generated_user_rules.py and used by Save Image w/ Metadata Universal to create your image metadata the next time you use it to save an image.\n\nThis is a node created by Copilot when it misunderstood my instructions.
